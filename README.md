# DroneServiceApplication

## Project Description
This application was created as a part of my Certificate IV in Information Technology (Programming) at South Metropolitan TAFE in 2022. This program uses Drone class objects to store an indefinite amount of drones (memory permitting) with five attributes (Client Name, Drone Model, Service Problem, Service Cost, and Service Tag). The priority of a Drone class object is deterimined by a set of two Radio Buttons (Regular and Express priority), then the Drone is added to the correct ListView which is refreshed.

Drones can be added to a queue by the user which enqueues the drone to the bottom of the ListView, which is the end of the queue. Once the drone is at the top of the ListView, it is able to be removed from the queue, which moves the drone to the finished list, which is a ListBox. A drone can be removed from the finished list by double clicking on the drone.
